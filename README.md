# Learning-Web-Dev
Journaling my journey as I learn Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Node)

1. Birthday Invitiation using HTML Only. Made chanegs to the original project I was told to construct to give it a bit more of an originality, however the image source and the maps link remain the same. First Project made under my HTML journey.
